    "# MuSE Plugin System\n",
    "\n",
    "MuSE allows you to add extra components to the `data_importer` system, the `evaluation` system, and the `summarizer` system without having to extend MuSE itself.\n",
    "To do this, you must add some python files in the `MUSE_PLUGINS` directory under `./importer`, `./evaluation`, and `./summarizer` respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "These systems will be loaded on running MuSE and will be available for use, taking priority over the default MuSE components, where conflicts arise.\n",
    "To implement these, you can create one or more files within the relevant directory, and implement the relevant abstract classes for each. \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, you can customise the existing systems with their options to fit your needs, but in the event that these also do not fit your needs, you can create a new system and use it in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using MuSE as a library, these plugins will be loaded automatically upon import of MuSE, and will be available for use in the same way as the default components."
