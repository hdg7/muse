Electric vehicles are an alternative to traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, offering environmental benefits and the potential for clean energy use. While EVs have a higher upfront cost, government incentives and lower maintenance expenses make them an increasingly competitive option. Challenges to widespread adoption include the need for more charging infrastructure and advancements in battery technology. Investments in fast-charging stations and research on solid-state batteries aim to address these issues and accelerate the transition to electric vehicles.
