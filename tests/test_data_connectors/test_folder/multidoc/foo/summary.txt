Urban green spaces provide environmental, social, and economic benefits. They improve air quality, reduce urban heat, and promote biodiversity. Parks foster social interaction, physical activity, and mental well-being. Economically, proximity to green spaces boosts property values and attracts tourists. Despite challenges in maintaining these areas, such as land development pressures and financial costs, their long-term benefits for sustainable urban living make them essential for cities' future development.
