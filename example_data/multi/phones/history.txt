Historical Overview

Mobile phones, often referred to as cellular phones, have revolutionized communication and technology. Their origins can be traced back to the early 20th century, when researchers began experimenting with radio frequency technology. However, it wasn't until the 1970s that the first commercially available mobile phones emerged. These early models were bulky, heavy, and expensive, limiting their widespread adoption.
